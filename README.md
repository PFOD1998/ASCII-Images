# ASCII-Images
Experimenting with images and ASCII characters

Original program (ascii.py) takes JPEG image as input and returns a .txt document with an ASCII representation of the image

webcam_ascii.py streams video directly from a webcam. It uses a combination of opencv and tkinter to take the stream frame by frame, convert it to ASCII characters and output it to an interface.
It has a three-button interface to invert, pause or save the ASCII representation
